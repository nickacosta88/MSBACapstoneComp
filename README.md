# First thing I did was model for outliers
# In order to do this I had to clean the datasets, merge necessary columns, and make sure I had the latest data set downloaded.
# Next, I wanted to keep my data "current" with my group so I copied over there code to ensure data scrutiny.
# Then, I modeled for the outlier detection to increase proficient accuracy.
# After I modeled the actual delivered cases within a decision tree model to understand how accurate this model method was, my RMSE was high which meant that the model was not accurate in its prediction.
# Lastly, I modeled customer segmentation by classification trees to cross validate the XGBoost segmentation created by Anais.
# This is all of my code for these steps.
